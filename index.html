    <h1>This is my side project of making a little game out of what I've learnt</h1>
    <p>I am a full time electrician and a part time self taught programmer going through The Odin Project.
        <br>
        I'm hoping this little side project helps me to concrete the things I've learnt and maybe make it fun for someone else to learn as well. I will try not to add too much more than
        what you have been taught to keep it as straight forward as possible... but also not completely ugly.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also find myself funny... sorry if you don't.
    </p>
    <p>
        But if you're reading this, cheers! And Good luck on your journey!
        <br>
        And if you're reading this thinking... man this guy did a terrible job. The whole project is on Github, feel free to make your additions. CSS is the devil.
