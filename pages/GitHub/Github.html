    <h1>Welcome to GitHub!</h1>
    <p>
        Well, You've covered quite a bit of downloading and not much fun stuff yet, but things are about to get interesting!
        Don't get me wrong everything you've read should already be re-read and implemented... terminal is your best friend.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now you have access to a playground full of a bunch of other peoples codes. It's a great place to find additional projects to work on while your learning.<br>
        If you find your skills improving you can even help others out here! (Please...someone save me from myself)
    </p>
    <p>
        Feel free to look me up! Hopefully this is posted on The Odin Project, and not just growing mold in my repos.<br>

        Have some fun, look around GitHub for some ideas for future or current projects, the more you code the better you'll get.
    </p>
